<p>Previous studies on whether foreign aid promotes democracy show contentious results and rarely delve into possible mechanisms behind democratization. This research argues that economic elites who benefit from foreign aid and who seek to secure property rights are a driving force of democratization. It is reported that foreign aid worsens economic inequality in recipient countries because of corruption, which forms a group of people who benefit from foreign aid and succeed economically. In countries with lower levels of democracy, the poor quality of property rights protection threatens the rich with governmentâ€™s expropriation. Thus, in less democratic countries, there is a stronger political force on the government toward achieving higher levels of democracy. In a cross-national analysis, countries are split into democratic and non-democratic countries to reflect the expected difference of the effect of foreign aid. Hierarchical models estimated by Bayesian inference demonstrate that foreign aid is positively associated with inequality across regimes, inequality is positively related to the level of democracy in non-democratic countries, and inequality is a stronger driving force for democratization in non-democratic countries.</p>
